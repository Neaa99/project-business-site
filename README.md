# Business Site

This is my third project for the Technigo boot camp where I designed a business site that has a signup form and an accordion.

## The problem

The problems I had was mostlu with the validation where i wanted the input to show a red border when it's invalid, but the red border shows up when you refresh the page, since I guess that the inputs are invalid from the start. I didn't like the look of it and desided to not do som CSS design with the validation. I also had problems with my videobackground who wasn't fully taking up the whole page, but I solved with help from the townhall meeting and by changing the height to 100vw!
